\section{General Concepts}
Before we go into commands specific to OpenCV; we should first understand a little about how image processing works.
\subsection*{HSV Values}
HSV Values are a set of values that represent colors; think RGB values, but instead of Red, Green, and Blue representing the color, it is Hue, Saturation, and Value. But just what do those values mean? Well, let's take a look. Open up somethiing such as a color picker for these values too, while you're at it to play around with things.
\subsubsection*{Hue}
Hue represents the color portion of an HSV model. These values extend from 0 to 360.
\subsubsection*{Saturation}
Saturation represents the amount of gray in a given color. This can also be known as Chroma, as we see in the figure below.
\subsubsection*{Value}
Value (sometimes also referred to as light) is the brightness of the color. This can range from 0 to 100.

\section{Commands}
OpenCV has a variety of commands to increase accuracy of object detection in images. Let's take a look at some and understand how each can improve object detection!
\subsection*{Blurring}
Blurring images can be rather resource intensive, but it is also a great way to reduce noise from an image and get better accuracy when trying to isolate individual objects. Blurs should be applied sparingly and only when necessary given how taxing they can be.

\subsection*{Erosion and Dilation}
Here we will take a look at two important operators for slimming down noise in an image based on the colors of the pixels themselves.
\subsubsection*{Erosion}
Eroding an image will get rid of pixels that are lighter in value by averaging out a certain are (kernel) of pixels.
\subsubsection*{Dilation}
Dilating an image does something fairly similar to eroding one, but instead it will get rid of pixels darker in value.

% Computing time as a function/frame rate is up next. (Hopefully)
